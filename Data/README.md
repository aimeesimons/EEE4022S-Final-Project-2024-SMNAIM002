## Data for training

This repository contains:
- y_classify.pickle -> which is the label data for the classification model
- y_detect.pickle -> which is the label data for the detection model

### The datasets, unfortunately, could not fit in this repository. Therefore, you can find the rest here:

This folder will contain:
- Location Data/ -> which is all the data required to train the line models
- X_detect.pickle -> this is the raw dataframes of three-phase voltage and current, before feature extraction
- X_detect_noisy_varied1.pkl -> this is the dataset used for training
- X_classify.pickle -> this is the raw dataframes of three-phase voltage and current, before feature extraction
- X_classify_noisy_varied1.pkl -> this is the first half of the dataset used for training
- X_classify_noisy_fixed1.pkl -> this is the second half of the dataset used for training
- GraphList_edges_classify1.pickle -> this is the list of Graph Objects used for training
- GraphList_nodes_classify1.pickle -> this is the list of Graph Objects used for training
